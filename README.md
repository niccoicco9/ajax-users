# Countrify

This project uses AJAX to request random users from the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/) and display them on the webpage. The users are categorized based on their country of origin.

## Handlebars.js Template

The handlebars.js file should already be located in the root directory.

However, if for some reason it is not, or if you would like to include the latest version, visit the [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/installation.html) page to download the file and include/replace in the root directory.

This file is required for the app to work.

## Sass Watch

In order for the scss changes to reflect on the css file, you must run the sass watch command.

In this case, on the command line go to the root directory. Then type in the following line.

```
sass --watch scss:css
```

## Running App Locally

To run the app locally, simply go to your root directory via your desktop (not command line) and double click on the **index.html** file. This should open a window on your browser displaying the app webpage.
